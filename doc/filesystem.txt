* Configuring OpenWRT to Use an External Drive as Root

These instructions are based on the general overview provided by the [[http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/extroot][OpenWRT wiki]], stripped down to just the options that I have selected.

** Install modules necessary for USB devices and for filesystems

I am configuring my system to use a standard Linux ext4 filesystem. You will have to format the external drive on a Linux system and then plug it into the router. You're on your own for this.

If building an image, use menuconfig to select the following modules:

 + Base System -> block-mount
   + Kernel Modules -> 
      + Filesystems -> kmod-fs-ext4
      + USB Support -> kmod-usb-storage
      + Block Devices -> kmod-scsi-generic

Otherwise, run "opkg install" on your running OpenWRT system to
install the modules:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  opkg install kmod-usb-storage
  opkg install block-mount
  opkg install kmod-fs-ext4
#+END_SRC

** Initialize the external filesystem

Because the MR-3020 is only supported by the trunk development version of OpenWRT, "Attitude Adjustment", we have additional choices of how to set up the external filesystem. There are two options: "pivot overlay", which works for Backfire (the current stable release) as well as Attitude Adjustment, or "pivot root", which only works in Attitude Adjustment right now.

I have chosen to use the "pivot root" method. To initialize the external filesystem, copy the standard root filesystem from flash memory to the external drive.

NOTE: This assumes that the new external drive is mounted on /mnt/sda1

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  mkdir -p /tmp/cproot
  mount --bind / /tmp/cproot
  tar -C /tmp/cproot -cvf - . | tar -C /mnt/sda1 -xf -
  umount /tmp/cproot
#+END_SRC

** Configuration

All of the configuration necessary to actually run the "pivot root" system that you have built is done in the /etc/config/fstab configuration file. The default fstab that OpenWRT ships with has a "config mount" stanza for a "/home" filesystem; I have replaced that stanza with the following, since /home will just be part of the external drive. 

#+BEGIN_SRC
config mount
       option target /
       option device /dev/sda1
       option fstype ext4
       option options rw,sync
       option enabled 1
       option enabled_fsck 0
#+END_SRC
