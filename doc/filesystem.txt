* Configuring OpenWRT to Use an External Drive as Root

** Install modules necessary for USB devices and for filesystems

If building an image, use menuconfig to select the following modules:

 + Base System -> block-mount
   + Kernel Modules -> 
      + Filesystems -> kmod-fs-ext4
      + USB Support -> kmod-usb-storage
      + Block Devices -> kmod-scsi-generic

Otherwise, run "opkg install" on your running OpenWRT system to
install the modules:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  opkg install kmod-usb-storage
  opkg install block-mount
  opkg install kmod-fs-ext4
#+END_SRC
