* Reading the State of the Sliding Switch on an MR-3020

It's actually very easy to read the state of the sliding switch on the
MR. First you make them available in /sys, and then you just read
them.

According to the [[http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-mr3020][OpenWRT wiki page]] for the hardware, the sliding
switch state is reported by two GPIO pins: 18 and 20. To make these
available in the filesystem, you remove the "gpio_button_hotplug"
kernel module, then export the buttons:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
rmmod gpio_button_hotplug

for i in 18 20; do
   echo $i >/sys/class/gpio/export
done
#+END_SRC

There are now two directories, /sys/class/gpio/gpio18 and
/sys/class/gpio/gpio20. To read from them, just cat the file
/sys/class/gpio/gpioN/value:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
$ cat /sys/class/gpio18/value
1
#+END_SRC

The values for the sliding switch are as follows:

| Label | GPIO18 | GPIO20 |
|-------+--------+--------|
| 3g    |      1 |      0 |
| WISP  |      0 |      1 |
| AP    |      1 |      1 |
